# Zelt Profile Editor

We want you to build a simple profile editor, allowing users to view and edit
their Zelt User Profile.

We've created a simple React project to get you started with a simple Mock API to allow you to get and set user information.

What we're looking for:

- A great user experience. Feel free to import any UI component libraries you're familiar with or do it all in HTML+CSS - we don't mind either.
- Quality over quantity. A small amount of well-coded work is better than a lot of partially-working code.
- Use of React components using hooks
- Production-ready code: no debugger statements or console.logs()!

To get started: run `npm start` in this folder and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. The rest is up to you!
